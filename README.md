# Autonomous Behavior Algorithms
This repository features algorithms for autonomous navigation, obstacle avoidance, localization, and decision-making in robots and drones.

## Key Features
- Path planning algorithms (A*, Dijkstra, RRT)
- Obstacle avoidance techniques
- Localization using particle and Kalman filters
- Decision-making with finite state machines and reinforcement learning

## How to Get Started
- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/Autonomous-Behavior-Algorithms.git`
- Follow the instructions in the [docs/installation_guide.md](docs/installation_guide.md).
